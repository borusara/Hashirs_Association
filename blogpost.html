         <p class="font1">Hashira Association is an association owned by @Hashira_Association . @ricks_005 . @AlphaLegacyInc... this is a platform where you can enjoy all the anime related features... you can download animated or nor animated profile picture, can download any anime series or movies for free, can also listen or read any quotes depending upon your mood so you that youu feel the way your mood is... you can join our demon slayer fanclub if you are a huge fan of demon slayer and like to chit chat/ discuss/ talk about it or you like theories and facts about demon slayer... </p>

         
         <p class="font1">Hashira Association was made for something else but as time passes, it slowly converted into a telegram network... a network where everyone can join and work for us... as time passes hashira became more serious about its projects and developing bots... Hashira had 2 bots at the starting phase, which are kyojuro rengoku bot and kurumi bot but unfortunetely the kurumi bot's support was closed and the bot became hopeless, but still the kurumi bot is active enough to manage group chat as it is still running in heroku's server but who knows when it gets discontinued as hashira totally left kurumi bot hopeless and forgot about it... as time passes, hashira made some friend networks
            which are red7 and team7, red7 and team 7 are same as hashira network... they make bots, groups and channels too... later hashira became a federation channel and came under telegram official's supervision. lately hashira spread it's wimgs and lots of people started joining hashira and 900+ peaple started following hashira association, it was a great achievement for us... but stil the rengoku bot doesnt hit much chats/ groups but lately rengoku bot got in lots of groups and started being loved by gc members... it was one of the great achievements so to celebrate it the flame hashira shared 3 google play redeem code of rs100 to the first three members who sees that...  </p> 
         <p class="font1">what happened to rengoku bot that they started developing a new bot ?. ANS: Actually, nothing was wrong in kyojuro rengoku bot but still there was some mistakes, kyojuro rengoku bot was made under telethon, which is a module of python but telethon cannot provide much features and is not fast enough as pyrogram. pyrogram is a python module too which is fast enough and can provide more features to the bot.. so they thought of making a new bot named mitsuri bot... </p>
        
         <p class="font1">The Hashira is a group of strongest demon slayer ! . Hashira is the highest rank in the demon slayer corps, and being one is same as being pillar of support for the demon slayer corps, each hashira has their unique breathing style but they all share the same goal which is to defeat all demons and protect humans.
